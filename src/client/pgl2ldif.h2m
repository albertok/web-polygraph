[DESCRIPTION]
Generates LDIF (and other text-based) configuration files from PGL
code. LDIF is the configuration format used by LDAP servers. To
generate a configuration file, one needs to create a template.
Polygraph substitutes well-known keywords in the template file with
credentials and other authentication-related information.
