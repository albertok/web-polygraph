[DESCRIPTION]
Given a zone name, DNS names, and IP addresses, dns-cfg builds
configuration suitable for use with BIND and, perhaps, other DNS
servers. Dns-cfg output consists of three parts. The first part is the
text to cut-and-paste into BIND's named.conf file. This part is sent
to the standard output. The outer two parts are direct and reverse
zone files. Those may be quite large and are dumped on disk into the
appropriately named files. Dns-cfg can use PGL configuration as the
source of information.
